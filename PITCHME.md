## Write Code Like the Go Team

In this first section of the course you’ll learn how to make your code look like it belongs in Go’s standard library, and why that’s important.  

Topics:

- how to organize your code into packages, and what those packages should contain  
- code patterns and conventions that are prevalent in the standard library  
- how to write your code to be more clear and understandable  
- unwritten Go conventions that go beyond “go fmt” and make you look like a veteran Go contributor wrote it

## Section One Outline

In this section we'll cover three main areas that will help you write code that looks more professional, performs better, and is easier to read and understand.

## Code Organization

The organization of your code is an area of frequent confusion even among seasoned Go developers.  

There are two key areas of code organization in Go that will make a huge impact on the usability, testability, and functionality of your code:

- Package Naming
- Package Organization

We can't talk about them separately because one influences the other.
